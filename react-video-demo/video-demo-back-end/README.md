## Quick start

If you just want to get the app running quickly to test it out, first install
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/), and follow along:
Go to the main folder video-demo-app then

```sh
npm install                                                   # install dependencies
npm run start                                                 # start the server, this will open a browser in localhost:3000
```
